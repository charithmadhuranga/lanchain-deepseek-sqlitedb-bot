    "## LangChain Agent for SQLite Database Interaction (CRUD Operations) with DeepSeek\n",
    "#\n",
    "### This notebook demonstrates how to create a LangChain agent that can interact with a SQLite database using the DeepSeek LLM. The agent will be able to:\n",
    "### - **Query (Read)** data from tables.\n",
    "### - **Add (Create)** new records to tables.\n",
    "### - **Update** existing records.\n",
    "### - **Delete** records from tables.\n",
    "#\n",
    "### We will use the `SQLDatabaseToolkit` and `create_sql_agent` function provided by LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setup and Installations\n",
    "### 2. Import Libraries and Configure Environment\n",
    "#\n",
    "### We need to import the required modules and set up our environment, particularly the DeepSeek API key. **It's highly recommended to use environment variables for API keys.**\n",

    "### 7. How it Works (Briefly)\n",
    "#\n",
    "#### 1.  **Input:** You provide a natural language request (e.g., \"List all users\").\n",
    "#### 2.  **Agent Thought Process:** The agent (powered by the DeepSeek LLM and toolkit) analyzes the request.\n",
    "#### 3.  **Tool Selection:** It determines that it needs to interact with the SQL database.\n",
    "#### 4.  **SQL Generation:** The LLM generates the appropriate SQL query (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users;`).\n",
    "#### 5.  **SQL Validation (Optional but Recommended):** The toolkit might include steps to validate the SQL syntax.\n",
    "#### 6.  **SQL Execution:** The agent executes the SQL query against the connected database (`user_database.db`).\n",
    "#### 7.  **Result:** The database returns the results of the query (or confirms the success/failure of INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).\n",
    "#### 8.  **Response Generation:** The agent formats the result into a natural language response (e.g., \"Here are the users: ...\").\n",
    "#\n",
    "#### Setting `verbose=True` when creating the agent allows you to see these intermediate steps (thought process, generated SQL, tool calls, observations).\n"

    "### 8. Conclusion\n",
    "#\n",
    "### We have successfully created a LangChain agent capable of performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a SQLite database using natural language commands powered by the DeepSeek LLM. This demonstrates the power of combining LLMs with specific toolkits like the `SQLDatabaseToolkit` for interacting with structured data sources.\n",
    "#\n",
    "### Remember to exercise caution when granting agents write permissions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to your databases in production environments. Also, ensure the chosen LLM and agent configuration are suitable and tested for SQL generation accuracy."
